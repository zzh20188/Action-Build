# Action-Build  
**```Build OnePlus SukiSU Ultra KPM Kernel```**
 
# Announcement  
The _x suffix in the configuration file indicates the system version you are currently using. _v stands for Android 15, _u for Android 14, _t for Android 13, and no suffix usually refers to the factory Android version of the device model.
 
Some devices have issues with ``lz4kd``, currently under investigation. **If it fails to boot, please do not enable ``lz4``**
 
Remember to install the module with **Volume Down**
